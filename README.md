### Data Analysis of Conflict in Ukraine
![Publication](/asset/ukraine.JPG)

The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has been marked by a complex interplay of military strategies, human losses, and societal responses. In an effort to comprehend the evolving dynamics of the situation, this analysis delves into various facets, ranging from equipment losses incurred by the Russian army to the human toll reflected in personnel casualties. Additionally, insights from sentiment analysis of social media and an interactive map displaying incidents resulting in civilian injury or casualties provide a comprehensive perspective on the multifaceted nature of the conflict. By examining trends in equipment losses, personnel casualties, and public sentiment, this study aims to shed light on the strategic implications, societal impact, and the evolving nature of the conflict in Ukraine. Through data-driven insights, we seek to gain a deeper understanding of the complexities inherent in this geopolitical struggle and explore potential avenues for informed decision-making and support for those affected by the conflict.

### Social Media Usage and its Relationship with Emotional Well-Being
[Report](/asset/Final_Report_ML.docx.pdf)

“67% of adolescents report feeling worse about their own lives as a result of their social media use.” Research like this and hints towards some type of relationship between social media and emotional well-being. Using data from AI researcher Emirhan Bulut, an in depth analysis was used to explore this relationship. The analysis contains exploratory data analysis, a classification model to predict dominant behavior based on social media usage and a clustering algorithm to determine if clusters existed within our data. From the analysis, it was determined that people who used instagram logged more time spent on their devices, LinkedIn users with a lot time spent on the app are almost always reporting their emotion as angry, we can very accurately predict someone’s emotion based on their social media usage with features like age, time spent on the platform and likes received as our most important predictors and some distinct clusters do exist within our data.
